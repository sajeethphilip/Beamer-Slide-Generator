Update:  BSG-IDE.py  is a complete Development IDE to create the text file and all intermediate steps to generate PDF presentation output.

Create a presentation slide in no time. That is the goal. Read the manual (RTM!) Contact me (nsp@airis4d.com) for clarifications. Contribute to the manual by adding your observations. AND Enjoy!

NOTE: You need not worry about creating the text file. That is the good news. You give a new file name, say <some_filename>.txt, after selecting the option 2. It will guide you through even suggestive pages on your browser related to the topic of your slide. You can follow the instructions. Copy and paste YouTube video links by selecting option 1 in the submenu, or add your own files by selecting option 2. No worries, the links will be automatically cited so that you won't be blamed for IP violation. Try it and let me know.
